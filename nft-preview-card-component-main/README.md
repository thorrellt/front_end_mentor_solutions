## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

This project helped me get more familiar with structuring layouts and working with different display types. Early iterations had me using a lot of px measurements to try to match the reference image. More research and and few iterations later and my design scales more consistantly based on the design provided font size of 18px.
