## My process
### Built with
- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties



### What I learned
This practice exercise was fairly straight forwards. I was aware upon looking at the design how to implement it.   
  
 The main hurdles I had to overcome were related to using a flexbox display. After some reading, I realized my mistake was not wrapping the element in a container in the html.  This allowed me the opportunity to realize a gap in my knowledge and begin to address it.
